        <h3>Part 2: Recording Observations </h3>
        <p>1)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There were too many buttons, users got confused</li>
            <li>One user was confused on how to open the microwave 
                because some have buttons and some open when pulled</li>
            <li>Users didnâ€™t know how to microwave for longer than a minute </li>
            <li>Users did not know to press time/cook before turning the knob to set longer than a minute </li>
            <li>Users assumed the knob could be used after 
                quick min to increase the time past one minute </li>
          </ul> 
          <p>2)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>How often do you use the microwave? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>At least once a week</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Why do you use a microwave? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is more convenient to heat up food than using a stove</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Did you know you had to press timer/clock before turning the knob to select a time? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>No, the users assumed that turning the knob would allow them to select a time longer than 1 min</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Do you ever use the extra buttons like defrost/popcorn? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>No, because users usually follow packaging instructions</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Do you know how to use these buttons? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>No, because users never use them</li>
                </ul>
            <li>How do you decide how long to microwave things for? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>From previous experience</li>
                <li>If a new thing is being microwaved, users will start with one minute and 
                    continue doing one minute increments until it is warmed up to their liking
                </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Do you prefer the knob or the number pad on a microwave? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Number pad because more convenient and less confsuing
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cuts out irrelevant timing (no one is going to microwave something 
                        for 28 seconds instead of 30 seconds)
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
